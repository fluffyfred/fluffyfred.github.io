Hello! I'm a Game Programmer currently majoring in Computer Science Games at USC. As you can see from my portfolio, I've worked on lots of different video games!

Quick demo video of all the games I made last semester (jump to 1:20 to skip the preface): https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV1Pu4y1c7PP/?spm_id_from=333.337.search-card.all.click&vd_source=c62ff921ac365ff5853b68dcb825f85a

If you're interested in what I can contribute to your studio or company, please contact me!
