Here's some impressive stuff I did:

* Using vector math to significantly slow down the cars when the frog is "in front of" them
* The frog is dead and will be teleported back to the origin point when it hits a car or drowns
* The frog can move left or right on a floating log and can jump from one log to another
* Leading edge detection so that the frog would not just go all the way in one direction
