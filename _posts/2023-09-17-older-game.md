Here's some impressive stuff I did:

* Goombas are not moving just one way--they can collide and reverse their direction upon collision
* 2D follow camera from left to right of the entire map
* When stepping on a goomba, Mario will be bounced up and then fall to the ground
* Using Euler integration for various physical simulations
* Goombas have a quick and seamless animation when dying
