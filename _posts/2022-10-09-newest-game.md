Here's some impressive stuff I did:

* A portal gun that allows the player to create at most two portals on almost any surface
* A pellet receiver that opens the gate when catching a pellet
* Turrets that randomly move around within a certain range and shoot at the player upon detection
* A 3D audio system that follows physical simulation (audio volume changes with the distance)
* Interaction between objects, such as collision between turrets and actors being killed or activated by pellets
* Teleport through the portals and the corresponsive matrix transformation & in-portal image
* Built-in timers for state transition of certain objects
