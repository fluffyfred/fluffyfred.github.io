Here's some impressive stuff I did:

* A recursive function to help achieve the effect of the plane's collision on barriers
* Barrel roll implementation and animation
* Randomly and infinitely generated map boundaries
* Special sound effect when the plane is not full health
* The plane is invincible while doing a barrel roll
* The plane can shoot pellets to destroy the barriers with a built-in timer
* Camera transformation when the plane moves around the yz-plane
