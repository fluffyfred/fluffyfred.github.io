Here's some impressive stuff I did:

* Different search and movement logic for the 4 ghosts, some are even dependent of others
* Basic AI pathfinding implementation (greedy algorithm)
* The ghosts become scared and move away from the pac-man for a while when he eats a power pellet
* If the pac-man encounters a scared ghost, that ghost will return to the origin of the map, wait for a while, and come out again unscared
* If the pac-man collects all the power pellets, the game is won and a piece of pleasant music will be played
