Here's some impressive stuff I did:

* Using vector math to determine which way the enemy kart should go to finish the current lap
* Spring camera implementation for a better immersive experience
* Using a height map to synchronously update the karts' positions when going up or down certain slopes
* An update function to determine the player rank, which is shown on the screen
* Basic UI implementation
* Audio switching when starting the 2nd lap
